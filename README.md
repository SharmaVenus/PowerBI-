As a "Data Analyst" working on personal project, I gave myself a task to understand listening patterns given the most famous songs as listed on Spotify, as well as various insights into each songs attributes.

Looking through the data, these were some of the questions I wanted to address:

What are the top 5 most streamed songs on Spotify?
Who are the top 5 artists with the most songs on Spotify?
What is the total count of songs as per top 5 Rankings ?
What is the count of songs as Solo artist and in Collaboration ?
% of songs in different modes?
